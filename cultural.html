    <h2>Patriarchy Dying or Reviving ?</h2>
    <p>Gender relations and gender roles have been changing over the years , women will no longer accept the roles assigned to them in the home , school , church and society. Instead they are shattering the impervious boundaries and reaching to expand in different industries that were once male dominated.</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>There has been a change in androcentrism and male dominance in society.</li>
      <li>Males  were expected to be  the head of society.</li>
      <li>Men were seen as the ones to be educated and receiving the better jobs while women were expected to be submissive and reserved.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Religion Depicts women as subordinate and men as strong and  robust</h3>
    <p>The bible essentially presents women as a subset of men as it is inferred from the creation story in Genesis that God made women subordinate to men.The Quran also denotes that women should submit to their husbands. Now all that has changed women are forming their own meaning and idea of their roles and responsibilities in society. The  recently reported that the first black female bishop in England is a Jamaican born Rev Dr. Rose Josephine Hudson-Wilkin. The viewpoint that males should dominate the public space has changed. The skewed judgement  of the womanâ€™s place in the church has been replaced with female pastors in the Caribbean,women are now liberated and this is evident not only in the new roles that they have taken on , but also in the way they dress and their interaction.</p>

    <h3>The Caregiver</h3>
    <p>Women are seeing to be a nurturer while men are seen as incapable of nurturing, the Caribbean has mistrust of child rearing by the father since mothers are seen as more emotional and able to relate and provide emotional support for the children. As a result there is mistrust with single fathers as we do not believe they are capable of raising children on their own.This is evident in our legal systems, mothers are more likely to receive guardianship/ custody than fathers, and also in schools, educators often request to have the mother visit the institution. Dominant socializing agent, tells a woman how she should dress and act, child rearing rules, be submissive to your husbands, women are allowed to be more vulnerable Hegemonic male, (men having power over women and other men because of , race , money , class ) now changes from just whites men to black men as well.</p>
    <p>(LGBT) can be referred under religion as well.</p>
    <p>Identity of  Caribbean has changed because of intolerance of the Eurocentric practices.

I intolerance and mistrust in all aspects are deeply entwined in our history. My colleagues and I decided to embark on this journey to gain a higher sense of Caribbean identity ,understanding where we are from , having a different interpretation of why people do things the way they do , why society is the way they are.

It is important to have a sense of history , without that knowledge we are not able to understand the way  society functions.</p>
